A code for a list of social media links styled using Elementor's icon list widget. The list includes links for phone, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Each link is represented by an icon and has an associated visually hidden text for accessibility. The HTML structure uses <ul> and <li> elements with appropriate classes for styling, and CSS is used to visually hide the text while keeping it accessible to screen readers. The purpose of this code is to provide a visually appealing and accessible way to display social media links on a website.
